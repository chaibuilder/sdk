# Chai Builder - Open Source Tailwind Builder

Chai Builder is an Open Source Low Code React + Tailwind CSS Visual Builder. 
It allows you to create web pages & email templates visually by dragging and dropping elements onto the canvas. 
It is a simple React component that renders a full-fledged visual builder into any React application.

      <ChaiBuilderEditor
          blocks={[{_type: 'Heading', _id: 'a', content: 'This is a heading', styles: '#styles:,text-3xl font-bold'}]}
          onSave={async ({ blocks, providers, brandingOptions } ) => {
            console.log(blocks, providers, brandingOptions );
            return true
          }}
